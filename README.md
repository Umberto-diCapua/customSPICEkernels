# Custom SPICE kernels
This repo is a collection of custom SPICE kernels, that I find useful.

- true_of_date.tf : true of date reference frame. Based on the guide found at [this link](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/frames.html#Defining%20a%20True%20Equator%20and%20Equinox%20of%20Date%20Frame%20in%20a%20Frame%20Kernel) and on an blog article I can't find anymore
